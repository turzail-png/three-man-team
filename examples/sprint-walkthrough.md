# A Complete Three Man Team Sprint

This is what a full step looks like from start to deploy.

## 1. Project Owner describes a problem to Architect

> "The user registration form doesn't validate email format on the server side.
> It only validates in JavaScript."

## 2. Architect diagnoses

Architect reads the relevant file, confirms the gap, and describes what the code
currently does. Then asks: do you want server-side validation only, or both?

Project Owner: "Both. JS for UX, server-side for security."

## 3. Architect writes the brief

Updates `handoff/ARCHITECT-BRIEF.md`:

```
## Step 12 — Server-side email validation on registration
- Add server-side email format validation to the registration handler
- Validate after sanitization, before DB write
- Return error message matching the existing error format
- JS validation already exists — do not modify it
- Flag: use the framework's built-in validator, not a custom regex
```

## 4. Architect runs adversarial review on the brief

```
/codex:adversarial-review --wait --scope working-tree "Full critique of Step 12 brief: ALL severities (critical, high, medium, low) — design trade-offs, hidden assumptions, missed edge cases, naming, doc gaps, scope risks."
```

Codex returns findings: "What about empty-string after sanitization? Internationalized
domain names? The validator's default error string is generic — does it match the i18n
contract? Naming nit: 'register handler' vs 'registration controller' inconsistency."

Architect writes `handoff/BRIEF-CRITIQUE.md` (severity-ordered, every level), accepts the
i18n finding (updates the brief to flag it), rejects the empty-string concern (sanitization
handles it), escalates the IDN question to Project Owner. Resolution filled in.

## 5. Architect spins up Builder

> You are Bob on this project. Load token-optimizer skill first.
> Then read BUILDER.md, then handoff/ARCHITECT-BRIEF.md (and handoff/BRIEF-CRITIQUE.md for context).
> Your task is Step 12.

## 6. Builder builds

Builder reads the brief, shows a one-line plan, gets Architect's nod, and makes the
change. Updates `handoff/BUILD-LOG.md`. Writes `handoff/REVIEW-REQUEST.md`.

## 7. Architect runs Codex review

```
/codex:review --wait --scope working-tree "Full review: ALL severities (critical, high, medium, low) — spec compliance, drift, security, logic, standards, known gaps."
```

Codex returns structured findings: validator used correctly, error format matches —
but the error string is not wrapped in i18n helper, contradicting Builder's brief note.
Severity: high. Plus low-severity nits: missing JSDoc on the new function, magic-number
threshold for max email length.

## 8. Architect writes REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md

- `## Must Fix`: error string not i18n-wrapped (file:line + recommendation).
- `## Should Fix`: missing JSDoc, magic number → constant. Both logged.
- `## Cleared` empty.
- `Ready for Builder: NO`.

## 9. Builder fixes

Wraps the error string in the project's i18n helper. Logs the JSDoc/magic-number nits to
`handoff/BUILD-LOG.md` Known Gaps for cleanup later. Resubmits.

## 10. Architect reruns Codex review

```
/codex:review --wait --scope working-tree
```

Verdict: approve. Architect writes `## Cleared` line, sets `Ready for Builder: YES`.

## 11. Architect deploys

Tells Project Owner: "Server-side email validation added. Codex flagged the error
string wasn't translatable — Bob fixed it. Two low-sev nits logged to Known Gaps. Clean."

Project Owner: "Ship it."

Architect commits, deploys, confirms, updates `handoff/BUILD-LOG.md` and `handoff/SESSION-CHECKPOINT.md`.
