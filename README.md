## The Problem With AI Coding Tools

AI coding tools are powerful but undisciplined. They read entire codebases when they
need one function. They add features nobody asked for. They drift mid-task. They burn
tokens on every session doing work that didn't need to happen.

The solution isn't a better prompt. It's a process.

Three Man Team gives you two Claude agents with distinct jobs, a Codex review gate at every handoff, and rules that prevent the most expensive failure modes. The Architect plans and deploys. The Builder builds exactly what the brief says. Codex challenges the brief and reviews the build — independent second opinion, every step.

---

## Why Two Claude Agents Plus Codex

DeepMind's multi-agent research shows teams of 3-5 with structured artifact handoffs
outperform both solo agents and larger groups. Three is not arbitrary — it is the
minimum for meaningful review and the maximum before coordination overhead eats the gain.

The original Three Man Team used a Claude Reviewer for the third role. This codex-integrated
version swaps that role for **Codex** (`/codex:adversarial-review` on the brief, `/codex:review`
on the build). The independent model is the point — a second Claude reviewing Claude's work
shares too many blind spots.

The roles map to how real software ships:
- Someone who understands the whole system and owns the deploy (Architect — Claude)
- Someone who builds fast and clean (Builder — Claude)
- An independent second opinion that catches what the builder missed (Codex)

---

## Quick Start

**How the team runs:** Three Man Team uses one Claude Code session. Arch is your main agent. When work is ready to build, Arch spins up Bob as a subagent via Claude Code's Agent tool. Code review is run by **Codex** via `/codex:adversarial-review` (after the brief) and `/codex:review` (after the build). You don't open three windows — Claude roles run inside your single session, Codex runs as a separate plugin process Arch calls.

**Prerequisite:** install the codex Claude Code plugin and run `/codex:setup` once per session before the first review gate.

Choose your install type:

---

### Per-project install (recommended)

One project, one install. Clone directly into your project folder.

**Step 1 — Navigate to your project folder and clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/russelleNVy/three-man-team.git .claude/skills/three-man-team
```

**Step 2 — Run setup and follow the instructions**

```bash
cd .claude/skills/three-man-team && ./setup
```

Setup takes over from here. It will give you the exact commands to run and the prompt to paste into Claude to get started. Follow what it prints.

---

### Global install (all projects)

Install once, use in any project.

**Step 1 — Clone to your global Claude skills folder**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/russelleNVy/three-man-team.git ~/.claude/skills/three-man-team
cd ~/.claude/skills/three-man-team && ./setup
```

That's the one-time install. Setup will confirm everything is in place.

---

**For each project you want to use Three Man Team on:**

**Step 2 — Copy agent files into your project, then spin up Claude**

```bash
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/three-man-team/templates/project-folder/. /path/to/your/project/
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Open Claude Code and paste:

```
You are the Architect on this project. Please read new-setup.md.
```

Arch will handle the rest — project context file, team names, and your first session prompt.

## The Workflow

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/workflow.png" alt="Three Man Team Workflow" width="100%">
</p>

Every unit of work follows the same path. Architect plans and writes the brief. Codex runs `/codex:adversarial-review` against the brief — Architect resolves findings before Builder starts. Builder reads the brief, shows a plan, builds, and writes REVIEW-REQUEST.md. Architect runs `/codex:review` and translates the output into REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md. Architect deploys with the Project Owner's go-ahead. Nothing skips a step.

See [docs/codex-integration.md](docs/codex-integration.md) for gate details.

See a complete example from problem to deploy → [`examples/sprint-walkthrough.md`](examples/sprint-walkthrough.md)

## The Team

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/role-cards-cropped.png" alt="Arch and Bob" width="100%">
</p>

Two Claude agents. One Codex review at every gate. Built to work together.

Architect and Builder are the defaults. Rename them to anything — Arch will handle it during setup. Code review is run by Codex (`/codex:adversarial-review` and `/codex:review`); not a renamable persona.

---

## Token Optimization

Every session starts with five rules baked into CLAUDE.md:

```
Is this in a skill or memory?   → Trust it. Skip the file read.
Is this speculative?            → Kill the tool call.
Can calls run in parallel?      → Parallelize them.
Output > 20 lines you won't use → Route to subagent.
About to restate what user said → Delete it.
```

The token-optimizer skill ships with every install and auto-loads via CLAUDE.md — no manual setup required.

For bash output compression on top of these rules, see [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) —
a separate tool that compresses `find`, `ls`, `grep` output before it reaches Claude's context.
Not required, but recommended for heavy Claude Code CLI users. The combination of RTK (bash layer)
+ token-optimizer (behavior layer) is where real savings compound.

See `docs/token-optimization.md` for the full discipline.

---

## Auto-Update

Arch checks the GitHub releases API at the start of every session. If a newer version is available, it tells you before doing anything else. See [releases](https://github.com/russelleNVy/three-man-team/releases) for what's changed.

---

## Templates

- `templates/project-folder/` — **Start here.** Named personas (Arch, Bob), fully written and ready to use. Customize the Who You Are sections and rename to fit your team. Code review is run by Codex, not a third persona.

Arch handles renaming during setup — just tell it the new names.
